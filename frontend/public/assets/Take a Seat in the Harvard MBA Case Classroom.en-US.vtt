[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:07.660
Today, we put ourselves in
the shoes of Cynthia Carroll.

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:14.170
Imagine you've become CEO of one
of the world's largest mining

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:16.570
companies, Anglo American.

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:22.960
$25 billion dollars in
sales, 162,000 employees,

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.720
two thirds of them
in South Africa,

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.680
and four months into your
job you hear the news

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:38.620
one of the miners in Rustenburg
has lost his life, yet

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.840
another fatality.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.250
You have to decide are you
going to shut down the mine

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.650
or continue business as usual.

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.200
David, if you can
open for us today.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.490
You're Cynthia Caroll.

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:54.500
The news comes to you.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.390
Do you shut down the mine
in Rustenburg, yes or no?

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:00.780
What are you going to do?

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.780
So I think she needs to initiate
very detailed investigations

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.280
into what happened in
these circumstances

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.900
and what has happened
throughout the past.

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.000
Are you going to shut
down or not shut down?

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.660
So I'm going to do a
detailed investigation.

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:18.548
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.432
When I do have a plan [laughing]

00:01:21.432 --> 00:01:22.890
What are you
learning, what are you

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.480
learning in this investigation?

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.330
Practices that are not
being followed correctly,

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.600
or out of line,
or could be safer,

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:30.730
where there's like issues.

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:31.630
People are dying.

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.600
It's not safe.

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.920
What evidence are
you looking for?

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.900
When you get the
opportunity to participate,

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.397
you need to be able to
compact the information

00:01:41.397 --> 00:01:42.980
that you're going
to present in a very

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.170
concise and clear manner.

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.020
Through participation
in class every day,

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.380
this is something that
I am trying to sharpen.

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.380
Who wants to get in on this?

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.890
It's dynamic, it's fast-paced,
there's a ton of energy.

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.860
And everyone's really excited
to jump in and contribute.

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.840
I learn a lot from
my peers, as much

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.190
as I learn from the
faculty, if not more.

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:03.870
The professor kind
of facilitates.

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:05.960
Like an orchestra, they
kind of direct the music,

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.880
but they're not
necessarily playing it.

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:09.530
So.

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:10.970
I think we need to shut it down.

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.970
Miner deaths are
accepted as just a part

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:15.530
of the process of mining.

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.860
Shutting down the operation
would signal a very strong

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.340
mentality shift that deaths
aren't going to be tolerated.

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.040
That's called a bold stroke, by
the way, what Grant is talking

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.470
about, what Jospeh
is talking about,

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.800
what Robert is talking about,
is a bold stroke, which

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.060
means from this day forward
something has shifted.

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.600
But those of you who
disagree say what?

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.310
Those of you disagree
say what, Will?

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:45.920
I think we do much
more to be improve

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.758
the culture around safety
and the entire organization.

00:02:48.758 --> 00:02:51.050
If there's some truth that
we're trying to work toward,

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:52.787
the debates become
more and more fun

00:02:52.787 --> 00:02:54.620
because that's when you
get to uncover views

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:55.850
that you haven't thought of.

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.390
And when you get to
push your own thinking

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.430
and hopefully make your own
thinking much, much better.

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.660
If you allow your perspective
to be constructively challenged

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.060
by other people, then
it is just fascinating

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.680
how know your position and
your perspective can shift.

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.270
Those of you who
want to shut down,

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:16.550
how do you respond to this?

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:17.420
Layla.

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.140
We shut down the plant
because we had safety issues.

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:21.020
And we made a stand.

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:24.230
And we started making a safety
culture, like we had a safety--

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.350
The fact that we can have
difficult, uncomfortable

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:29.390
conversations, we
can talk about race,

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:32.450
we can talk about
politics, and still

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.230
be friends at the
end of the day.

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.950
And to have people who are
not from a specific group,

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:43.100
but still have sympathy and
empathy is pretty unique.

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:44.690
Beyond cultural and
beyond structural,

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.240
we also talk about the
people of the organization.

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:48.730
The overseers are
generally white

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.050
and the workers are
generally black.

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:51.758
The language with
which they communicate,

00:03:51.758 --> 00:03:53.820
it's called [INAUDIBLE],,
and it's largely

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.130
a command and control language.

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:57.320
So you're saying
some structural.

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:00.170
You're saying some linguistic
communication barriers.

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:03.950
You're saying some
organization cultural issues

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:06.750
around the entire organization.

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.780
I think this also
gives you humility.

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.330
Your perspective is not
enough to figure out

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:12.890
the answer to a question.

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:16.459
And actually gives you the
ability to ask other people

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:18.410
what their perspective is.

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:21.970
Just 27 countries represented
in our section of 94 people,

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.450
and because of the way that
the case method is structured,

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:25.867
we can sort of get
underneath what

00:04:25.867 --> 00:04:27.428
are those differences
really tied to.

00:04:27.428 --> 00:04:28.970
Are their cultural
things about where

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:31.250
you come from that makes the
business world operate slightly

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:32.625
differently, and
are there things

00:04:32.625 --> 00:04:34.610
that we can learn from
those differences.

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:36.480
I think consumers
are critical here.

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:39.380
So not only do they care
about having high quality

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:41.840
inputs to their
supply chains on time,

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.340
but they will also
care about safety.

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.940
In the first month or
couple weeks of class,

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:48.860
I was hesitant to participate.

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:52.130
But over time, I've gotten
rid of all of my barriers

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:55.130
and don't really have any
qualms about participating.

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:58.800
But a lot of that is because of
the support of my classmates.

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.830
And not only do I see
it changing in myself,

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.890
but I see my classmates
making better points

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:08.240
over time, which then also
again pushes me to be better.

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.420
Stakeholder analysis
is so, so important

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:13.100
when we think about change.

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:14.570
So important to do.

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:17.270
We think about who do
we need to worry about

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:19.980
and what do they care about,
what are their interests.

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:23.550
And so you start there,
but that's not enough.

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:29.090
You have to then say, where do
I need to invest the most time?

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:32.780
Who is in this cell?

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:33.830
The board.

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:35.850
I'm really worried
about the managers.

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:38.120
I think the government's
also key in here.

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:40.790
Being in the case
setting you realize

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:43.820
how valuable everyone
else around you is,

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:45.560
and how valuable
their opinions are,

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:49.400
and the importance of being a
really good, active listener.

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:53.630
So before we shift from this
and think about some action

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:56.510
planning, I just want
to show of hands,

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:59.160
because it's not clear to me
in this room, how many of you

00:05:59.160 --> 00:05:59.930
are shutting down?

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:04.690
Really?

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:07.810
And how many of you
are not shutting down?

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:10.498
So most of you are
not shutting down.

00:06:10.498 --> 00:06:10.998
Wow.

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:16.770
So are we going to
resolve this now?

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:20.267
Or are there points
that we need to make?

00:06:20.267 --> 00:06:22.350
I don't know if I think
this is a performance gap.

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:23.850
I don't know this is
about best practices.

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:25.058
To me, this is about culture.

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:28.665
If all of these, like--

00:06:28.665 --> 00:06:31.352
if all these miners were
like white and not black,

00:06:31.352 --> 00:06:33.810
I think that death rates would
look very, very differently,

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:35.430
because I think
people would consider

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:37.430
the value of the lives
of the people in the mine

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:38.890
very differently.

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:42.000
The question we have to
ask is, is this company

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.120
extracting more value from the
community than it's providing?

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.490
It's scary to be vulnerable
in a working world.

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:50.340
So you're oftentimes
taught to put up a shield.

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:52.320
But here, you're given
an environment that

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:54.840
supports you to take those
risks and actually celebrates

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:57.960
failures or celebrates
diversity of thought when

00:06:57.960 --> 00:06:59.400
you don't agree with someone.

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:02.100
Jumping into the
arena, using your brain

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:04.230
to come to the best
hypothesis and conclusion

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:06.560
that you can given
the data that you have

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.690
is a task that leaders
have to do every day.

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:12.780
And how do you use limited
information to make a decision

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:15.060
and do that in a
way that forces you

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:17.770
to flex that muscle of
dealing with ambiguity?

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:19.060
They don't get it, Jake.

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:21.380
Yeah, in dragging get
back up to the front line

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:23.100
to the CEO position,
one of the things

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:24.978
that I was thinking
about is not just

00:07:24.978 --> 00:07:26.603
all of these different
elements that we

00:07:26.603 --> 00:07:29.186
should be concerned because of
safety, but also the leadership

00:07:29.186 --> 00:07:31.070
capabilities in younger self.

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:35.020
You reliably took positions
at your previous company that

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:37.530
were incredibly
unpopular and encountered

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:39.130
all sorts of resistance.

00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:41.610
And I think this is a case
where you show me you can do it,

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:43.380
and so I would shut
down the company.

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:45.692
This situation is
different, don't you think?

00:07:45.692 --> 00:07:48.150
Is she suited for this job?

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:50.110
Can she do this?

00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:52.350
I think that's an incredibly
challenging question.

00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:53.691
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:57.350
That's what we do, Jake.

00:07:57.350 --> 00:08:01.430
This is what we do.

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:05.095
This is what we do.

00:08:05.095 --> 00:08:09.760
We push students to take a
position or to take a stand,

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:13.330
because it forces
students to think

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:16.540
deeply, to think
about risks, to think

00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:19.540
about the weaknesses
in their ideas,

00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:22.990
and to also be
open to influence.

00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:25.810
I want them to set high
standards for themselves.

00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:28.150
I want them to be challenged.

00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:30.680
I want them to challenge others.

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:32.320
So what initially
brought me here

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:35.559
was that I wanted to
complement the skills that I've

00:08:35.559 --> 00:08:37.539
developed in architecture
and consulting

00:08:37.539 --> 00:08:40.570
with business skills.

00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:45.220
But once I got here, those
priorities completely changed.

00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:48.550
What inspires me
now is really having

00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:51.860
super engaging
discussions with my peers.

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:54.250
I don't think that I've ever
been that intellectually

00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:57.940
stimulated on a day to
day basis as I am here.

00:08:57.940 --> 00:09:00.010
And I think for me
that's inspiring

00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:03.670
and it just wakes me up
every day with excitement.

00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:06.160
I think I recognized
that I wasn't

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:08.800
pushing myself to
think differently

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:10.420
or to lead differently.

00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:12.940
I wasn't going to do
anything extraordinary.

00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:15.040
And I thought maybe
if I came here

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:17.470
I would be pushed
in a way that would

00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:22.030
lead me to develop into someone
who could change something.

00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:24.790
At HBS, there's
just no one here who

00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:27.280
wants to come out the
same way they came in

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:29.290
and that's really exciting.

00:09:29.290 --> 00:09:32.140
30 years ago, Cynthia
Carroll, 30 years ago,

00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:36.730
was actually in your seats,
in these exact same seats.

00:09:36.730 --> 00:09:41.080
And because of her,
thousands and thousands

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:47.710
of miners in the world are
paid better, are much safer,

00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:51.880
and are leading better lives
with much more dignity.

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:54.960
One day, not only
that could be you,

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:58.290
I know that one
day it will be you.
